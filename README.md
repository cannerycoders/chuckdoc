# chuckdoc

Here you'll find a markdown representation of the [ChucK](https://chuck.cs.princeton.edu)
documentation including standard `chugins` and `classes`.  As of 1/23/21, this is the most up-to-date 
version  and complete of ChucK docs that I've found. The updates are the result of ample code spelunking
and will remain a work-in-progress.

`showdownjs` was used in default mode validate the conversion to html.

A small amount of work remains to automate the offline creation of a static
html website.  Currently, css styling tends toward the _dark_. There
are substitution 'macros' at the top and bottom of each page that must
be applied.
